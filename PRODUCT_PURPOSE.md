# Branded Objects - Product Purpose

## Core Purpose

**Branded Objects lets agencies turn brand guidelines into locked design tools that clients can use safely.**

### The Problem
- Agencies create brand guidelines (PDFs, Figma files)
- Clients still create off-brand assets
- Manual approval processes are slow and don't scale
- Agencies waste 15-25 hours/month on asset creation/approval

### The Solution
**Build a locked design tool where clients can only edit what you allow.**

## What It Actually Does

### For Studios (Agencies)
1. **Build a Tool** (like Figma)
   - Design freely: Add layers, position, style, content
   - Set locks: Choose which properties clients can edit
   - Publish: Get a public URL

2. **Lock Properties**
   - **LOCKED** = Hidden from client (can't see or edit)
   - **CLIENT_INPUT** = Client can edit this
   - Everything else stays exactly as designed

3. **Share with Clients**
   - Give clients the public URL
   - They see only editable fields
   - They export perfect, on-brand assets

### For Clients
1. **Open Tool URL** (no login needed)
2. **Fill in Editable Fields** (only what studio unlocked)
3. **Export Asset** (perfect, on-brand, instant)

## Core Value Proposition

### For Studios
- **Productize Services**: Sell tools as subscriptions, not hours
- **Scale Without Scaling**: One tool = infinite outputs
- **Guaranteed Compliance**: Technically impossible to break brand
- **Reclaim Time**: 15-25 hours/month saved

### For Clients
- **Self-Service**: Generate assets instantly, no waiting
- **No Design Skills**: Just fill in the blanks
- **Always On-Brand**: Can't accidentally break design

## The Lock System (Core Feature)

Each property has 3 states:

1. **LOCKED** 🔒
   - Hidden in client view
   - Can't be changed by clients
   - Studio can edit in builder
   - Example: Background color, logo position

2. **READ_ONLY** 👁️
   - Visible in client view
   - Can't be edited by clients
   - Shows what's fixed
   - Example: Subhead text, fixed copy

3. **CLIENT_INPUT** ✏️
   - Visible and editable in client view
   - Clients can change this
   - Example: Headline text, product image URL
